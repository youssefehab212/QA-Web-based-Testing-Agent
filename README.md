# QA-Web-based-Testing-Agent
The objective is to build a Web-based Testing Agent that acts as a capable partner for QA  Engineers. This project is not about building a generic script; it is about creating a  "Human-in-the-Loop" assistant that solves real-world testing challenges: exploration, test  design, and implementation.
