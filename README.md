# QA-Web-based-Testing-Agent
The objective is to build a Web-based Testing Agent that acts as a capable partner for QA  Engineers. This project is not about building a generic script; it is about creating a  "Human-in-the-Loop" assistant that solves real-world testing challenges: exploration, test  design, and implementation. 

System Architecture: 
● Interface: A web-based chat interface facilitating a dialogue between the Human Tester 
and the Agent. 
● Visual Context: The Agent must control a visible browser instance. The user should see 
the work happening in real-time to build trust. 
● Observability & Metrics: The system must provide insight into the "Agent's Brain." 
○ Must display granular metrics: Average Response Time (per iteration/page) and 
Tokens Consumed (per iteration/page). 
○ Visualization using tools like MLFlow, LangFuse, or custom dashboards.
